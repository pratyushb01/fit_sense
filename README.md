# Fit Sense

Fit Sense is a small Python project for virtual clothing "try-on" and size detection. It uses camera calibration data and image processing to project garments (sample t-shirts) onto a live camera feed or images.

## Contents

- `try_on.py` — Main entry for the virtual try-on/demo.
- `size_detect.py` — Utilities for estimating clothing size / detecting a person's size from images.
- `camera_calibration.py` — Script to calibrate the camera and save `calibration_data.npz`.
- `calibration_data.npz` — Saved camera calibration data (generated by `camera_calibration.py`).
- `Resources/Shirts/` — Sample shirt assets used for overlaying during try-on.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used by the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Setup

Open a PowerShell prompt in the project directory (`d:\fcv_proj\fit_sense`) and run:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the demo / try-on application:

```powershell
python .\try_on.py
```

Behavior and available CLI options depend on the scripts' implementations — check the top of each file for usage notes and available flags.
